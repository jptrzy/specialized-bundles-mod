# 🤔 Often Questions 
**Why sometimes I don't see the content of specific bundle?**
Unfortunately it is a known issue.

**Why server doesn't load the resource pack?**
Check, if you have [Polymer](https://modrinth.com/mod/polymer) installed on server side and enabled auto-host as described [here](https://polymer.pb4.eu/latest/user/resource-pack-hosting).
